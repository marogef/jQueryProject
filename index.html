        Paris, France
        </summary>Lingering over pain au chocolat in a sidewalk cafe, relaxing after a day
        of strolling along the Seine and marveling at icons like the Eiffel Tower and the
        Arc de Triomphe the perfect Paris experience combines leisure and liveliness with
        enough time to savor both an exquisite meal and exhibits at the Louvre.<br>

        New York City, USA
        </summary>Conquering New York in one visit is impossible. Instead, hit the
        must-sees - the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, the
        Metropolitan Museum of Art - and then explore off the beaten path with visits to
        The Cloisters or one of the city's libraries. Indulge in the bohemian shops of the
        West Village or the fine dining of the Upper West Side. The bustling marketplace
        inside of Grand Central Station gives you a literal taste of the best the city has
        to offer.<br>

        London, UK
        </summary>The crown jewels, Buckingham Palace, Camden Market… In London, history
        collides with art, fashion, food, and good British ale. A perfect day is different
        for everyone: culture hounds should hit the Tate Modern and the Royal Opera House.
        Clotheshorses will drool over Oxford Street shops. For foodies, cream tea at
        Harrod's or crispy fish from a proper chippy offers classic London flavor. Music
        and book buffs will freak out over Road and the Sherlock Holmes Museum (at 221B
        Baker Street, natch).<br>

        Rome, Italy
        </summary>Rome can't be toured in a day, either. The city feels like the exhibit
        halls of a giant outdoor museum, a real-life collage of piazzas, open-air markets,
        and mind-boggling historic sites. Toss a coin into the Trevi Fountain, drop your
        jaw at the Colosseum and the Pantheon, and fuel up on cappuccino for an afternoon
        of shopping at the Campo de'Fiori or Via Veneto. Dig into a plate of fresh pasta,
        some succulent fried artichokes, or a tender oxtail stew for one of the best meals
        of your life.<br>

        Barcelona, Spain
        </summary>Barcelona feels a bit surreal-appropriate, since Salvador Dali spent time
        here and Spanish Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí designed several of the city's
        buildings. Stepping into Gaudí's Church of the Sacred Family is a bit like falling
        through the looking glass - a journey that you can continue with a visit to Park
        Güell. Sip sangria at a sidewalk café in Las Ramblas while watching flamboyant
        street performers, then create your own moveable feast by floating from tapas bar
        to tapas bar.<br>

        Venice, Italy
        </summary>With its gondolas, canals, amazing restaurants, and unforgettable
        romantic ambiance, Venice is definitely a city for one's bucket list. Waterfront
        palazzos, palaces, and churches make drifting down the Grand Canal feel like
        cruising through a painting. To really experience Venice you must go to the opera
        or to a classical music performance, nibble fresh pasta and pastries, and linger in
        the exhibit halls of an art gallery. Label lovers will drool over the high-end
        shopping in Piazza San Marco.<br>

        Sydney, Australia
        </summary>Sydney offers plenty of historical and contemporary Australian flavor.
        The marvelous Sydney Opera House looks like a great origami sailboat, floating
        peacefully in a harbor. Wander the narrow cobblestone streets of The Rocks and then
        take in a street performance on the Circular Quay before heading into the Museum of
        Contemporary Art. The views from the Sydney Tower Eye observatory are epic - use
        this chance to get to know the layout of the city from high above.<br>

        New Delhi, India
        </summary>Delhi is a city that bridges two different worlds. Old Delhi, once the
        capital of Islamic India, is a labyrinth of narrow lanes lined with crumbling
        havelis and formidable mosques. In contrast, the imperial city of New Delhi created
        by the British Raj is composed of spacious, tree-lined avenues and imposing
        government buildings. Delhi has been the seat of power for several rulers and many
        empires for about a millennium. Many a times the city was built, destroyed and then
        rebuilt here. Interestingly, a number of Delhi's rulers played a dual role, first
        as destroyers and then as creators.<br>

        Istanbul, Turkey
        </summary>The mosques, bazaars, and Turkish baths of Istanbul could keep you
        happily occupied for your entire trip: an eyeful of breathtaking architecture here,
        a good-natured haggle over a carpet there. Kick your trip off at the awe-inspiring
        Sultan Ahmet Camii (Blue Mosque), which is visible from many points of the city.
        Stroll the Galata Bridge and stop by the Miniaturk Park to see its tiny artifacts.
        The Grand Bazaar has thousands of shops to browse, while the Egyptian Bazaar is a
        fragrant trove of spices and fruits.<br>

        Tokyo, Japan
        </summary>Tradition collides with pop culture in Tokyo, where you can reverently
        wander ancient temples before rocking out at a karaoke bar. Wake up before the sun
        to catch the lively fish auction at the Tsukiji Market, then refresh with a walk
        beneath the cherry blossom trees that line the Sumida River. Spend some time in the
        beautiful East Gardens of the Imperial Palace, then brush up on your Japanese
        history at the Edo-Tokyo Museum. Don't forget to eat as much sushi, udon noodles,
        and wagashi (Japanese sweets) as your belly can handle.<br>

        Beijing, China
        </summary>Move over, Haussmann and l'Enfant. Beijing's urban planner beat you by a
        couple of centuries. His name is Kublai Khan. Here, you'll find a wealth of
        history, both ancient (the Hall of Preserving Harmony, Summer Palace, Forbidden
        City) and more recent (Chairman Mao Memorial Hall, Tiananmen Square). For the best
        market experience, choose the Dirt Market over the touristy Silk Market.<br>

        Cairo, Egypt
        </summary>Cairo's an ancient city that also happens to be a modern metropolis-it's
        one of the biggest cities in the Middle East and has the traffic and noise issues
        to prove it. But as long as you're not looking for solitude, Cairo-the City of the
        Thousand Minarets-is a splendid place to explore Egyptian history and culture.<br>

        Wodeyar dynasty and is considered the cultural capital of the state. Mysore is the
        second cleanest city in India and one of the most well-planned ones. The people of
